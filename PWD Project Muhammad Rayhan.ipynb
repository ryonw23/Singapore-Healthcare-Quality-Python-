Singapore boasts one of the strongest healthcare systems in the world, ranking first in the Legatum Prosperity Index in terms of health [1]. While much attention has been given to policies and funding, how the healthcare workforce count affects the healthcare quality remains underexplored despite numerous efforts to bolster the numbers in the healthcare workforce."

However this avenue itself comes with challenges like high costs and long waiting times. It is estimated that the costs ranges from \\\\$52 to \\\\$102 per session without transport fees [9]. Along with that, waiting times for the application process may take up to four weeks [10]. Both the high costs and long waiting times can be attributed to the less than proportionate increase of the number of therapists in the public sector compared to the private sector.

Increasing the healthcare workforce numbers alone is not sufficient to meet rising demands as this study highlights that absolute growth does not guarantee improved quality. Vulnerabilities in the healthcare system appear due to the disproportionate healthcare workforce distribution in the private and public sectors as well as potential skill dilution during the sudden growth of the healthcare workforce, particularly for nursing.\\\n",
